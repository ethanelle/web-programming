### About this repository
This is a collection of 5 major steps in evolving a JavaScript program from the command line to a dynamic website. Each folder contains its own README file that explains each individual step.

### About the project
The program is a document storage and keyword finding program. The basic idea behind each phase is that the user adds some text documents to the collection and then calls on the program to find keywords in the documents. The program will return the documents that contain the keywords as well as the number of occurences and the line of its first occurence.
